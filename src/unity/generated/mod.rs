//! # Bindgen Conversions for Unity IL2CPP Headers
//!
//! This module provides Foreign Function Interface (FFI) bindings generated by [bindgen] for a specific version of
//! the Unity IL2CPP headers.
//!
//! The bindings encapsulated in this module correspond to Unity IL2CPP header version `2022322f1`.
//! They allow Rust code to interact with the underlying Unity IL2CPP runtime through the automatically generated
//! interfaces.
//!
//! ## Module Structure
//!
//! - **`il2cpp_2022322f1`**: Contains the raw bindgen output for the Unity IL2CPP headers, version `2022322f1`.
//!   This submodule holds the conversion details necessary for interfacing with the Unity runtime.
//!
//! The contents of `il2cpp_2022322f1` are re-exported at the top level to simplify the usage of these bindings.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Simply include this module in your project to access the IL2CPP FFI bindings. Ensure that your project
//! properly links against any required Unity libraries.
//!
//! ## Notes
//!
//! - These bindings are auto-generated and tailored for a specific version of the Unity IL2CPP headers.
//! - Depending on your Unity version or project requirements, additional adjustments might be necessary.
